# In this vpn server /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf file:
## update the CLIENT1_PUBLIC_KEY with your master public key
(NOTE: While updating the worker nodes public keys in the wg server's config, make sure if the wg interface IP is the correct one associated to the public key)
## update the CLIENT2_PUBLIC_KEY with your client2 public key
## update the CLIENT3_PUBLIC_KEY with your client3 public key
## update the CLIENT4_PUBLIC_KEY with your client4 public key
