# Starting kubelet on master node. we maybe have a question on why kubelet is run on master node?
# The reason for running kubelet on master node is that, kubeadm uses containers (pods) to deploy etcd and the api server components. 
# For this, static manifests are created as yaml-files which are picked up by the kubelet on the master node 
# to provide the infrastructure pods. An added benefit is that you have the master node metrics available from the kubernetes api.
